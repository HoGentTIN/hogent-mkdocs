Some text here.

## Website

Anything that allows you to embed a website, you can use too:

<iframe

You can scroll, zoom in/out, ... .

## Graphs

You can use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) to create diagrams from text:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Enter Chart Definition] --> B(Preview)
    B --> C{decide}
    C --> D[Keep]
    C --> E[Edit Definition]
    E --> B
    D --> F[Save Image and Code]
    F --> B
```

You can also use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/news) to create diagrams from text:

```puml
@startuml
participant Participant as Foo
actor       Actor       as Foo1
boundary    Boundary    as Foo2
control     Control     as Foo3
entity      Entity      as Foo4
database    Database    as Foo5
collections Collections as Foo6
queue       Queue       as Foo7
Foo -> Foo1 : To actor
Foo -> Foo2 : To boundary
Foo -> Foo3 : To control
Foo -> Foo4 : To entity
Foo -> Foo5 : To database
Foo -> Foo6 : To collections
Foo -> Foo7: To queue
